"""Every Jev question the server asks, in one reviewable place.

Kept deliberately separate from the call sites so the policy can be audited
without reading the code that acts on it, as TypeSafe recommends:
https://docs.typesafe.ai/agent-skill

Style rules followed here (https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/how-to-build-with-system-one):

* One atomic judgement per question. Broad questions hide several judgements
  behind one number; atomic ones can be inspected and combined in code.
* Structured ``criteria`` (``what`` / ``not_for`` / ``examples``) rather than a
  dense prose string.
* No arithmetic and **no date reasoning**. jev-1.13 reads dates as text, not as
  ordered quantities, so "is this due within 24 hours?" is answered in Python,
  never here. https://docs.typesafe.ai/model-jaggedness/jev-1.13
